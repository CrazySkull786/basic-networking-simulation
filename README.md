# Basic Networking Simulation 🚀
This project showcases a basic networking system designed using Cisco Packet Tracer, created as part of the Cyber Sentinel Program. The task involved designing a simple yet functional network topology for the virtual task assigned by Mehar Muhammad Shaban Raza.

## 📘 Overview

The goal of this simulation was to configure:
- Two routers
- Switches and PCs in separate subnets
- Proper IP addressing
- Inter-network communication using routing and ping tests

While I had been introduced to similar concepts earlier in my academic coursework, this task gave me a hands-on opportunity to reinforce and apply that foundational knowledge practically.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Basic Routing Configuration
- IP Addressing
- ICMP (Ping) Testing
